Purpose
-------
This project provides a management UI component for two back-end APIs to demonstrate polyglot development on Kubernetes

Dependencies
------------

Two constructed URLS - based on Host Name - It could be done better
* Provider API: URL_PROVIDER = "http://" + os.getenv('URL_PROVIDER', '') + ":8080/provider-api/api/v1/providers/"
* Reliant Party API:  URL_RELIANTPARTIES = "http://" + os.getenv('URL_RELIANTPARTIES', '') + ":8080/api/v1/reliantparties/"

This assumes the dependencies are running in the same Kubernetes Name Spae

Basic Commands
--------------

Setting Up Your Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

* To create an **superuser account**, use this command::

    $ python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

Type checks
^^^^^^^^^^^

Running type checks with mypy:

::

  $ mypy management_ui

Test coverage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report::

    $ coverage run -m pytest
    $ coverage html
    $ open htmlcov/index.html

Running tests with py.test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
